## 2024-05-22 - Static Site Optimization Limits
**Learning:** This is a pure static site without a build process (no package.json). Optimizations are limited to HTML modifications (resource hints, CDN usage).
**Action:** Focus on browser-level optimizations like `preconnect`, `preload`, and lazy loading (though no images found yet) rather than build-time optimizations like minification or tree-shaking.
